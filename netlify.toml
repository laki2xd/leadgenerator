# Netlify Configuration
# ⚠️ WARNING: Netlify is NOT recommended for this Flask app!
# 
# Limitations:
# - Serverless functions have 10-second timeout (your searches take longer)
# - No persistent file storage (exports won't work)
# - No persistent state (progress tracking won't work)
#
# Better alternatives: Render, Railway, or Fly.io
# See DEPLOYMENT.md for details
