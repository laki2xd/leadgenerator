# ✅ GitHub Repository Creation Settings

When creating your repository, here's what to select:

---

## ✅ Correct Settings

### **Add README**
- **Setting**: ❌ **OFF** (toggle switch should be OFF)
- **Why**: You already have a `README.md` file in your project
- If you add another README, it will conflict with yours

### **Add .gitignore**
- **Setting**: ❌ **"No .gitignore"** (dropdown should say "No .gitignore")
- **Why**: You already have a `.gitignore` file that includes:
  - `config.py` (your API keys - important!)
  - `exports/` folder
  - Other important exclusions
- If you add another .gitignore, it might override yours

### **Add license**
- **Setting**: ❌ **"No license"** (dropdown should say "No license")
- **Why**: Optional - you can add one later if needed
- For now, skip it

---

## ✅ Summary

**Leave everything OFF/No selection** and click **"Create repository"**

Your repository should be created empty, ready for you to push your code!

---

## 🎯 After Creating Repository

Once you click "Create repository", GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions.

**Copy the repository URL** - it will look like:
```
https://github.com/laki2xd/lead-generator.git
```

Then come back here and I'll help you push your code!
